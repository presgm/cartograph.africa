# Cartograph.Africa

**A modular framework for trade visibility, trust architecture, and public infrastructure across African markets.**

---

**Cartograph.Africa** is a protocol studio and open development initiative exploring how product movement, authenticity, and supply integrity can be better understood and mapped within African trade systems.

This is not a final product.  
It is an evolving framework, shared publicly for aligned exploration, research, and field validation.

---

## Purpose

Across the continent, trade is vibrant but underdocumented.  
Distribution is dense, but often invisible.  
Trust is essential—but rarely mapped.

Cartograph exists to explore:
- Modular tools for mapping informal and formal trade routes
- Distributed verification frameworks for goods and products
- Regionally adaptable trust scoring mechanisms
- Community-led data and field infrastructure models

We build for clarity, not centralization.  
This is public infrastructure in draft form.

## Projects

| Project | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `marketmap` | Active | Visualization prototype for product movement and supply asymmetries |
| `trust-index` | In Development | Experimental model for mapping reliability across regions and categories |
| `protocol-drafts` | Active | Foundational logic for future verification systems |
| `field-data` | Upcoming | Exploration of decentralized contributor networks and local knowledge capture |

Each module is intended to operate independently or as part of a larger public-use system.
